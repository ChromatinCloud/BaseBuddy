# samtools, bamsurgeon, art_illumina, nanosim-h are typically installed via conda/bioconda
# and are external tools. Listing them here might be misleading for a pip-only user,
# as pip won't install the command-line tools themselves, only potential Python bindings if they exist.
# It's better to refer to docs/dependencies.md for these.
