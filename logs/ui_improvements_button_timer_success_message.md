# UI Improvements: Button Timer and Enhanced Success Messages

**Date**: 2025-06-24  
**Features**: 
1. Auto-enable simulation button after 7.5 seconds
2. Enhanced success message with detailed file information

## 1. Button Re-enable Timer

### Problem
- Users couldn't start a new simulation while one was running
- No way to recover if a simulation appeared stuck

### Solution
- Added 7.5 second timer that re-enables the "Run Simulation" button
- Allows users to start another run if needed
- Prevents permanent UI lockout

### Implementation
```python
# Start a timer to re-enable the button after 7.5 seconds
def enable_button_after_delay():
    self.after(7500, lambda: button_to_disable.configure(state="normal"))

timer_thread = threading.Thread(target=enable_button_after_delay)
timer_thread.daemon = True
timer_thread.start()
```

## 2. Enhanced Success Messages

### Before
```
Run 'braf' completed successfully.
Output Directory: /path/to/output
Output Files:
  - Simulated Reads (R1) (FASTQ): gui_sim_reads1.fq
  - Simulated Reads (R2) (FASTQ): gui_sim_reads2.fq
```

### After
```
SIMULATION SUCCESSFUL
==================================================
Run Name: braf
Output Directory: /Users/lauferva/Desktop/Professional/Projects/2025/GOAL/BaseBuddy/test_output/braf
==================================================

Generated Files:
  FASTQ Files:
    - gui_sim_reads1.fq
    - gui_sim_reads2.fq
  Alignment Files:
    - chr7_140753336_140753436_aligned.bam (BAM)
    - chr7_140753336_140753436_aligned.bam.bai (BAI)

==================================================
TIP: Click 'Open Output Directory' to view all files

Manifest: manifest.json
```

### Improvements
1. **Clear success indicator** - "SIMULATION SUCCESSFUL" header
2. **Better organization** - Files grouped by type (FASTQ, Alignment, Other)
3. **Full output path** - Shows complete directory path
4. **Visual separators** - Makes information easier to scan
5. **Helpful tip** - Reminds users about the "Open Output Directory" button
6. **Cleaner formatting** - Indented file lists with clear hierarchy

## Benefits

1. **Better user feedback** - Clear indication of success with all relevant details
2. **Improved workflow** - Can start new simulations without waiting for completion
3. **Easier file location** - Full paths and organized file listings
4. **Professional appearance** - Well-formatted output messages

## Technical Notes

- Timer uses tkinter's `after()` method for thread-safe GUI updates
- Files are automatically categorized by type for better organization
- Success/failure messages have distinct formatting
- All emojis removed for better cross-platform compatibility
