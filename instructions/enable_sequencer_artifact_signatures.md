2. InSilicoSeq

InSilicoSeq is a more modern and versatile simulator that supports multiple platforms from a single interface.

    Functionality: It can generate reads with learned, empirical error models for Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore. This allows you to simulate data for a wide range of applications, from short-read to long-read sequencing.
    Best For: Projects that require simulating data from different sequencing technologies or for comparing their outputs.
    Heavy Lifting?: No, it is designed for ease of use. It's available as a Python package (pip install InSilicoSeq) and has clear, well-documented options.

Where to Find It: The project is actively maintained on its GitHub repository.
